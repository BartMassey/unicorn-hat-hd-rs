# unicorn-hat-hd [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhelwig/unicorn-hat-hd-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jhelwig/unicorn-hat-hd-rs)

Rust library for interacting with the Pimoroni Unicorn HAT HD.

## Documentation

The docs can be found online at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/unicorn_hat_hd/), or be built using `cargo doc`.

## Example

Add `unicorn_hat_hd` to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
unicorn_hat_hd = "0.2"
```

Add `unicorn_hat_hd` to your crate root.

```rust
extern crate unicorn_hat_hd;
```

Create a default `UnicornHatHd`, and start setting some pixels.

```rust
use unicorn_hat_hd::UnicornHatHd;

pub fn main() {
    let mut hat_hd = UnicornHatHd::default();
    loop {
        for y in 0..16 {
            for x in 0..16 {
                hat_hd.set_pixel(x, y, [255, 255, 255].into());
                hat_hd.display().unwrap();
                hat_hd.set_pixel(x, y, [0, 0, 0].into());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Emulated display

In order to help make development of apps that use the library a little
faster/easier/less-painful, you can turn on emulation of the physical display,
so that it can compile on platforms other than Linux & the Raspberry PI.

In the `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.unicorn_hat_hd]
version = "*"
default-features = false
features = ["fake-hardware"]
```

Though, you should replace the `version = "*"` with an actual version
constraint. Another thing of note is that the emulated display mode does not
respect any display rotation that has been set, and will always output as though
`Rotate::RotNone` were set.
